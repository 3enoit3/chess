Checklist
=========
# My checklist
## On each move
1. What is my opponent trying to do **and** how would I reply to it?
2. Is there a forced move? **chess and captures** (threats and pawn ruptures look more positional)
3. Improve the position: attack weaknesses, improve worst piece...
   * Review the strategic plan
  
Would like to include: candidate moves

## On attack
1. ignore
2. escape
3. defend
4. attack (there or somewhere else)

## State of mind
* Play **solid**: accumulated small advantages > possible opponent blunder
* Play **offensif**: fast attack > slow defense/prophylaxy
* Be vigilant with **pawn pressure**
  * non contested center
  * on a blocked bishop
* Follow the **rules**
  * on outposts: knight > bishop

  2. Calcul des lignes forcees (scan tactique): _echecs, prises, menaces, rupture de pions_
  3. Un coup positionel (faiblesses, ma piece moins bien placee)
  4. Que veut faire mon adversaire plus globalement: _prophylaxy_
