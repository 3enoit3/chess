Checklist
=========
# My checklist
## On each move
_The "fist" of chess_
1. Can I **ignore** the last move? any threat
2. Can I **force** a move? any check, capture or kick
3. Can I **exploit** a weakness? any funny alignment or unprotected piece
4. Can I **improve** my pieces? any underworking piece
5. Can I **secure** from an invasion? any entering square

-> Collect moves and choose the one serving multiple purposes

### Old
1. What is my opponent trying to do **and** how would I reply to it?
2. Is there a forced move? **checks and captures** (threats and pawn ruptures look more positional)
3. Improve the position: attack weaknesses, improve worst piece...
   * Review the strategic plan
  
Would like to include: candidate moves

## On attack
1. ignore
2. escape
3. defend
4. attack (there or somewhere else)

## State of mind
* Don't waste **time**: fast attack > slow defense/prophylaxy
* Play **solid**: accumulated small advantages > possible opponent blunder
* Know the **pawn structure** you play for, and be vigilant with pressure
  * on the center: not contested
  * on the sides: on a blocked piece (bishop)
* Follow the **rules**
  * on outposts: knight > bishop
 
### Pawns
* Use:
  * **majority** to **pass** pawns
  * **minority** to **destroy** opponent structure
* Avoid small islands, and keep their number small (one island = one weakness)
  * playing with:
    * keep mobile (PP) to guard or push to destroy opponent structure
    * use outposts for knights and side files for rooks -> **stay in middle-game**
  * playing against:
    * attack the base, blockade or weaken the structure (split into smaller islands or force into chains)
    * trade pieces -> **enter end-game**

  1. L'interet du dernier coup de mon adversaire
  2. Calcul des lignes forcees (scan tactique): _echecs, prises, menaces, rupture de pions_
  3. Un coup positionel (faiblesses, ma piece moins bien placee)
  4. Que veut faire mon adversaire plus globalement: _prophylaxy_

## Yevhenii Yellisieiev - Journey to Grandmaster
  1. What is the respective plam or idea for your opponent
  2. What is your general plan/idea that you want to implement in this game

-> Find a move which can stop your opponent's plan and develop yours

Active opportunities for any side: checks, captures, threats and active moves
