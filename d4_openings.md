## Indian
* N first, to delay decision between Indian and Nimzo
* if London, then Indian
  * attack the isolated pawn d4 with c5
  * then 2 options:
    * get Q out, for 2 plans: Qb6 to attack d4 and b2, or Qa4 to attack K and rank 5
    * prepare e5: d6 to block invasion, secure king with fianchetto + support with Nd7, Re8  
* if Queen's gambit, then Nimzo
