Pieces
======

# Where do pieces go
* Knights
    * short range pieces: need advanced support points to be effective
    * ranks: [1 and 2]:bad, [3]:defense, [4]=Bishop, [5]>Bishop, [6]:attack
    * closed positions + blockaders of passed pawns (Bishop: tall pawn, Rook: open files, Queen: wasted)
 * Bishops
    * long range pieces: need active post (good or outside pawn chain) to be effective
    * good/bad: central pawns of different/same color
    * open positions
 * Rooks
    * _cannon_: need open lines to be effective
    * ranks: 7 for the opponent's pawns (doubled is even stronger) or 8 for the king
